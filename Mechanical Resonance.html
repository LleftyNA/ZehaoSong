							<h5 class="margin-top-30 margin-lg-top-40">Introduction</h5>
							<p>What is mechanical resonance? Do you know that mechanical resonance can be very dangerous? 
							See this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mclp9QmCGs&ab_channel=SimonLesp%C3%A9rance" style="color:blue;">video</a>!
							Mechanical resonance is essential in musical instruments, architecture, and mechanical
system design. The damping effect will always influence the oscillatory system, which re-
duces oscillation amplitude. The experiment will cover the mechanical resonance of a mass
attached to a hacksaw blade in this lab. An accelerometer[<a href="#ct1" style="color:red;"><b>1</b></a>] is connected to the end of the
blade, so the motion of the mass can be measured by Labview. A magnet is placed at the
end of the blade and uses a bar of copper to add magnetic force to add damping.
							All analysis code are in python. If you need the code for your project, sorry I can't help you, but I can 
							provide some information. Feel free to contact me.
							</p>
						</div>

							<h5 class="margin-top-30 margin-lg-top-40">Abstract</h5>
							<p>
							I report here on measurements of the amplitude of oscillation, the phase shift between the
input voltage and motion, and transient decay data. I will use different methods to fit the
damping coefficient of three other damping cases: minimal, moderate, and high damping.
Then, the fitting results are used to calculate quality factor Q, a dimensionless parameter
that shows how underdamped an oscillatory system is.
							</p>

						</div>
					
							
						<div>
							<h5 class="margin-top-30 margin-lg-top-40">Method, Experiment and Result</h5>
							<p>
							The accelerometer will report position in the unit of voltage, which is not a good unit for
studying motion. By turning the whole system ±90 deg, the ratio between voltage and
gravitational acceleration can be easily found. The result is 0.32V = g. So I can divide
my voltage data by a factor of 0.32 to get in the unit of g. The value for g is 9.8m/s<sup>2</sup>.
							</p>
							<p>
							Connecting the function generator to a vibrating driver[<a href="#ct2" style="color:red;"><b>2</b></a>] and put the driver’s end on
the hacksaw blade near the anchor block(around 2cm). There is some position requirement.
If the driver is placed too close to the accelerometer, it will lose contact with the blade. On
the other hand, being too close to the anchor block will greatly reduce the effectiveness of
the driver. Setting up the voltage of function generator V<sub>pp</sub> = 2V , so the amplitude will be
around 1V . Then, find the point where the amplitude of oscillation is the largest, which in
my case, the resonance frequency is f = 12.9kHz. Next, I measured several points around
this frequency to process further analysis. The oscillatory motion is fitted to
							</p>
							<p id="eq1">$$X(t) = X_{0} + A\cos\left({\frac{ 2\pi t}{T} + \varphi}\right) \ \textbf{,} \label{Eq:1}$$</p>
							
							<p>
							where X is the position of the mass, X0 is the offset/initial position of the mass, A is
the amplitude of the oscillation, T is the period and φ is the phase shift factor. By using
the curve fit algorithm in Python, an estimated value for amplitude will be the result. With
resonance frequency w0 and damping coefficient γ, the amplitude and frequency follow the
relationship
							</p>
							<p>$$|a_{0}(w)| = \frac{\omega^2 \left(\frac{F_{0}}{m} \right)}{\sqrt{\left(\omega_{0}^2 - \omega^2 \right)^2 + 4\gamma ^2\omega^2}} \ \textbf{.} \label{Eq:2}$$</p>
							
							
							<p>
							F0/m is assumed to be a constant. By plotting amplitude vs frequency data and curve fit it, I get
the minimal damping fitting in Fig. <a href="#fg1" style="color:blue;"><b>1</b></a>. Results are resonance frequency ω0 = 12.92±0.02kHz
and damping factor γ = 0.239 ± 0.083. The error is estimated from the standard deviation.
As we can see, the curve fits the data well. The resonance frequency is close to 12.9kHz
and the damping factor is close to zero, which means there is not a lot of force that causes
damping to the system. Next, I repeat the process for moderate damping by moving the
copper bar on top of the magnet, covering nearly half of the magnet with the copper bar.
Repeating the fitting process for amplitude, then use the fitting result for estimating ω0
and γ. I get the following result, see the middle plot of Fig. <a href="#fg1" style="color:blue;"><b>1</b></a>. The fitting result shows
ω0 = 12.96 ± 0.06kHz and damping factor γ = 2.038 ± 0.463, which is still consistent
with our resonance frequency. The γ increases reveal that the magnetic force creates some
damping effect, which reduces the oscillation. After that, by moving the copper position
to cover the whole magnet, the system will receive the largest magnetic force, which will
cause the most damping. See the right side plot of Fig. <a href="#fg1" style="color:blue;"><b>1</b></a>. I get ω0 = 12.99 ± 0.12kHz
and damping factor γ = 5.190 ± 1.033. The resonance frequency still stays consistent at
12.9kHz, and the damping factor increases a lot. Comparing three damping cases, we can
see that from Fig. <a href="#fg1" style="color:blue;"><b>1</b></a>, minimal damping results in the least outer force, so when the frequency
is near resonance, the amplitude of oscillation increase significantly. Compared to the first
case, moderate damping has a much lower amplitude at the resonance frequency, which
reveals damping can affect oscillation crucially. In the high damping case, the amplitude
at resonance frequency is the lowest, which means outer force prevents the system from
oscillating a lot.
							</p>
							<img src="assets/images/Amp total.png" class = "imgcenter" id = "fg1">
							
							<p>
							Another way to estimate resonance frequency and the damping factor is to use the relationship between phase shift and frequency by the following equation
							</p>
							<p id="eq3">$$\theta = \arctan \frac{2\gamma \omega}{\omega^2 - \omega_{0}^2} + \delta \ \textbf{,} \label{Eq:3}$$
							</p>
							<p>
							where θ is the phase shift angle between the input voltage and oscillation, and δ is the offset
of phase shift. The offset may be caused by the voltage shift of the accelerator and DAQ
device. So the phase shift value will be θ<sub>accel</sub> − θ<sub>input</sub>. By fitting Eq. (<a href="#eq1" style="color:red;"><b>1</b></a>) for both voltages, I
get estimate values for phase shift φ and subtract them.
							<p/>
							
							<p>
							After using Eq. (<a href="#eq3" style="color:red;"><b>3</b></a>) and fit for ω0, γ and δ of minimal damping data, I get results with
ω0 = 12.92 ± 0.02kHz, γ = 0.455 ± 0.132 and δ = −0.29 ± 0.09. Repeating the phase shift
fitting method for moderate and high damping data, I get moderate damping data fitting
and high damping data fitting(in Fig. 2). From the fitting result, all ω0 values are in the
range of 12.9kHz, and γ increases with the damping effect. For moderate damping cases,
I get ω0 = 12.927 ± 0.05kHz, γ = 2.067 ± 0.371 and δ = −0.33 ± 0.09. For high damping
cases, results are ω0 = 13.0 ± 0.10kHz, γ = 5.001 ± 0.735 and δ = −0.33 ± 0.09.

							</p>
							
							<p>
							Comparing all three phase shift fitting in Fig. <a href="#fg2" style="color:blue;"><b>2</b></a>, we can see that the phase shift drops
significantly around the resonance frequency. With the damping effect, the dropping process
becomes smoother. The theoretical phase shift is | − π| at f = 0, π/2 at f = ω0 and 0 at
f = ∞. From the plot, the phase shift from all damping cases agrees with the theoretical
value. Thus, the estimated value for ω0 stays consistent.
							</p>
							<img src="assets/images/Shift total.png" class = "imgcenter" id = "fg2">
							<p>
							The last method is to estimate parameters from transient decay data. To measure the
data, use a finger to pull the mass away from the stationary point, release it, and let it oscillate until it stops. With frequency f , damping factor γ and phase shift φ, the oscillation
follows the equation
							</p>
							<p id="eq4">
							$$A(t) = A_{off} + Ae^{-t\gamma}\cos\left({2\pi ft + \varphi}\right) \ \textbf{,} \label{Eq:4}$$
							
							</p>
							<p>
							where A is the amplitude of decaying data and t is the time. In this way, we find a relationship
between decaying harmonic motion and time.
							</p>
							<p>
							Taking 20 seconds for transient decay data of each case, when the damping effect gets
large, the oscillation stops faster. Minimal damping takes a long time to decay, moderate
damping data with a transient decay process happens in a short time interval, and high
damping data stops around one second.
							</p>
							<p>
							By using Eq. (<a href="#eq4" style="color:red;"><b>4</b></a>), first, fitting for resonance frequency ω0 = f and damping factor γ of
minimal damping data, the result is shown in the left plot of Fig. <a href="#fg3" style="color:blue;"><b>3</b></a>, with the resonance
frequency of ω0 = 12.9069 ± 0.0001kHz and damping factor γ = 0.2204 ± 0.0001. From χ2
and fitting value of w0, we can see that the model and estimate value stay consistent with
data.
							</p>
							<img src="assets/images/Decay total.png" class = "imgcenter" id = "fg3">
							
							<p>
							Second, repeat fitting transient decay data for moderate damping. The data set has a
short time range, so I need to choose where the fitting should be. I choose data between
0.1s and 1s because the oscillating pattern is clear. From the middle plot of Fig. <a href="#fg3" style="color:blue;"><b>3</b></a>, from
the axis interval range, we see that the decay process has a much faster decay rate. I get
ω0 = 12.9187 ± 0.0002kHz, γ = 2.0544 ± 0.0015. Comparing χ2 to the degree of freedom of
fitting data, the model stays consistent with the data, and the ω0 value is consistent.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Third, using heavy/high damping transient decay data to fit, I need to select a concise
time range near t = 0. The reason is that the decay process happens very fast, and when
t = 0, it may have some inaccurate data because that is when releasing my finger. See the
right side plot of Fig. <a href="#fg3" style="color:blue;"><b>3</b></a>. The fitting results are w0 = 12.9370±0.0002kHz, γ = 5.8680±0.0012
which states that the damping increases with a faster decay rate, which is understandable.
The resonance frequency stays near 12.9kHz.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							All three methods have a consistent estimation of the resonance frequency. Some γ values
are different. The γ value is more significant than the other two methods in the minimal
damping from the phase shift case. We didn’t have enough data points when frequencies
were approaching zero. If more data points cover different frequencies, the fitting will get
more accurate. Another idea that should be paid attention to is the formula I use which is decaying simple harmonic motion, the condition for the model is the torque must be
proportional to angle acceleration[<a href="#ct3" style="color:red;"><b>3</b></a>]. In lab experiment cases, this condition can’t be met
perfectly, it always has some external factors which affect the system, such as slight miss
contact with the vibration driver, drag force from air, and external conductors other than
the copper bar.</p>
<p>
A quality factor Q describes how underdamped an oscillation is. The larger the Q is,
the higher the amplitude will be. The value of Q determines the qualitative behavior of
simple harmonic motion in the following three ways: low-quality factor system, which states
the system to be overdamped; high-quality factor system, which states the system to be
underdamped; intermediate quality factor system, which states the system to be critically
damped. The formula for Q is
$$Q = \frac{\omega_{0}}{2\gamma} \ \textbf{,}$$
rom previous estimation of ω0 and γ, we know that ω0 = 12.9kHz. I calculate Q factor for
each method, see the following table.

							</p>
							
							<div>
							
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Q factor value</th>
    <th>Amplitude method</th>
    <th>Phase shift method</th>
    <th>Transient decay method</th>
    <th></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Minimal damping</td>
    <td>26.99</td>

    <td>1.24</td>
    <td>1.29</td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>
The table shows that the high damping effect causes a lower quality factor value, which
states that the system is overdamped. The system displaced from the equilibrium steady-
state and returned to it by exponential decay will approach the steady-state value asymptotically. In our minimal damping cases, the Q value is the largest, which means the system
is underdamped and oscillates multiple times before reaching equilibrium. There is a critical
value for Q, which states that the system is critically damped and reaches the equilibrium
point the fastest. These ideas can be implicated in many modern applications, such as
dampers. A damper is a device that prevents oscillation, it is used in buildings, bridges, or
even a boat. In architecture, resonance can cause destruction and disaster because of the
power generated by high amplitude. To prevent it, a damper in mechanical design will be
crucial.
</p>
<p>
As we can see, the damping effect is one of the essential parameters in mechanical reso-
nance. The γ value can be estimated from different methods and can be used to calculate
the quality factor.
